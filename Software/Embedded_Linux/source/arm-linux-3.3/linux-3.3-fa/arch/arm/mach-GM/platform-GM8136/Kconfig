          Manual setting of AHB clock, must match the jumper setting on
          the board, or the system time won't be correctly calculated.
          Notice that even when AUTO_SYS_CLK is ON, this value is still
          required for adjusting minor time offsets. However, the influence
          should be within micro-second to nano-second scale.
