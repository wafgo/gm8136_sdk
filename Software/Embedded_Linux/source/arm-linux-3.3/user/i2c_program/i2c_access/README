iaccess provide the capability of reading and writing I2C messages by standard
Linux way. You can check its brief usage by typing:

$i2c_access --help

There are four usages:
1. i2c_access I2C_ADDR w [B][B]...[B][B] r [B]
2. i2c_access nostop I2C_ADDR w [B][B]...[B][B] r [B]
3. i2c_access I2C_ADDR w [B][B]...[B][B]
4. i2c_access I2C_ADDR r [B]

I2c_ADDR: the I2C address of the specific device you want to talk, 7bits format
nostop:   the first method will insert a stop between write cmd and read cmd, nostop won't
r/w:      specify r, w to read or write the following data byte
[B]:      when writing, this means 8 bits data byte,
          when reading, this means the number of byte will be read

Take RTC-PT7C4307 for example, its i2c address is 0x68 in 7bit-format. We want 
to get the "second" infomation it provides, which is stored in its register with 
address offset 0x00. We can type as following:

$i2c_access 0x68 w 0x00 r 0x01

Then you will get something like:
read: 0x02
