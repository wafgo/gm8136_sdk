Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 3.0.1 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux

I am pleased to announce the availability of
   mdadm version 3.0.1

It is available at the usual places:
   countrycode=xx.
   http://www.${countrycode}kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/
and via git at
   git://neil.brown.name/mdadm

This contains only minor bug fixes over 3.0.  If you are using
3.0, you could consider upgrading.

The brief change log is:
   -    Fix various segfaults
   -    Fixed for --examine with containers
   -    Lots of other little fixes.
