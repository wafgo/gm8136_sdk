Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 3.0.2 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux

I am pleased to announce the availability of
   mdadm version 3.0.2

It is available at the usual places:
   countrycode=xx.
   http://www.${countrycode}kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/
and via git at
   git://neil.brown.name/mdadm
   http://neil.brown.name/git?p=mdadm


This just contains one bugfix over 3.0.1 - I was obviously a bit hasty
in releasing that one.

The brief change log is:
   -    Fix crash when hosthost is not set, as often happens in
	early boot.
