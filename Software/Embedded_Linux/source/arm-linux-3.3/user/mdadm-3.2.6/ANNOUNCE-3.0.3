Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 3.0.3 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux

I am pleased to announce the availability of
   mdadm version 3.0.3

It is available at the usual places:
   countrycode=xx.
   http://www.${countrycode}kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/
and via git at
   git://neil.brown.name/mdadm
   http://neil.brown.name/git?p=mdadm


This contains a collection of bug fixes and minor enhancements over
3.0.1.

The brief change log is:
   -    Improvements for creating arrays giving just a name, like 'foo',
	rather than the full '/dev/md/foo'.
   -    Improvements for assembling member arrays of containers.
   -    Improvements to test suite
   -    Add option to change increment for RebuildNN messages reported
	by "mdadm --monitor"
   -    Improvements to mdmon 'hand-over' from initrd to final root.
   -    Handle merging of devices that have left an IMSM array and are
	being re-incorporated.
   -    Add missing space in "--detail --brief" output.
