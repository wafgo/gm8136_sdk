Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 3.1 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux

Hot on the heals of 3.0.3 I am pleased to announce the availability of
   mdadm version 3.1

It is available at the usual places:
   countrycode=xx.
   http://www.${countrycode}kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/
and via git at
   git://neil.brown.name/mdadm
   http://neil.brown.name/git?p=mdadm


It contains significant feature enhancements over 3.0.x

The brief change log is:
   -    Support --grow to change the layout of RAID4/5/6
   -    Support --grow to change the chunksize of raid 4/5/6
   -    Support --grow to change level from RAID1 -> RAID5 -> RAID6 and
        back.
   -    Support --grow to reduce the number of devices in RAID4/5/6.
   -    Support restart of these grow options which assembling an array 
	which is partially grown.
   -    Assorted tests of this code, and of different RAID6 layouts.

Note that a 2.6.31 or later is needed to have access to these.
Reducing devices in a RAID4/5/6 requires 2.6.32.
Changing RAID5 to RAID1 requires 2.6.33.

You should only upgrade if you need to use, or which to test, these
features.
