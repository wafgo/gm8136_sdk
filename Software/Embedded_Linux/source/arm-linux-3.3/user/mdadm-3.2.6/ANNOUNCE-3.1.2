Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 3.1.2 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux

I am pleased to announce the availability of
   mdadm version 3.1.2

It is available at the usual places:
   countrycode=xx.
   http://www.${countrycode}kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/
and via git at
   git://neil.brown.name/mdadm
   http://neil.brown.name/git?p=mdadm

This is a bugfix/stability release over 3.1.1.

Significant changes are:
  - The default metadata has change again (sorry about that).
    It is now v1.2 and will hopefully stay that way.  It turned
    out there with boot-block issues with v1.1 which make it 
    unsuitable for a default, though in many cases it is still
    suitable to use.
  - Stopping a container is not permitted when members are still
    active
  - Add 'homehost' to the valid words for the "AUTO" config file
    line.  When followed by "-all", this causes mdadm to
    auto-assemble any array belonging to this host, but not
    auto-assemble anything else.
  - Fix some bugs with "--grow --chunksize=" for changing chunksize.
  - VAR_RUN can be easily changed at compile time just like ALT_RUN.
    This gives distros more flexability in how to manage the
    pid and sock files that mdmon needs.
  - Various mdmon fixes
  - Alway make bitmap 4K-aligned if at all possible.
  - If mdadm.conf lists arrays which have inter-dependencies,
    the previously had to be listed in the "right" order.  Now
    any order should work.
  - Fix --force assembly of v1.x arrays which are in the process
    of recovering.
  - Add section on 'scrubbing' to 'md' man page.
  - Various command-line-option parsing improvements.
  - ... and lots of other bug fixes.


This release is believed to be stable and you should feel free to
upgrade to 3.1.2
