Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 3.1.3 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux

I am pleased to announce the availability of
   mdadm version 3.1.3

It is available at the usual places:
   countrycode=xx.
   http://www.${countrycode}kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/
and via git at
   git://neil.brown.name/mdadm
   http://neil.brown.name/git?p=mdadm

This is a bugfix/stability release over 3.1.2

Significant changes are:
   -    mapfile now lives in a fixed location which default to
        /dev/.mdadm/map but can be changed at compile time.  This
	location is choses and most distros provide it during early
	boot and preserve it through.  As long a /dev exists and is
	writable, /dev/.mdadm will be created.
	Other files file communication with mdmon live here too.
	This fixes a bug reported by Debian and Gentoo users where
	udev would spin in early-boot.
   -    IMSM and DDF metadata will not be recognised on partitions
        as they should only be used on whole-disks.
   -    Various overflows causes by 2G drives have been addressed.
   -    A subarray of an IMSM contain can now be killed with
        --kill-subarray.  Also subarrays can be renamed with
	--update-subarray
   -    -If (or --incremental --fail) can be used  from udev to
        fail and remove from all arrays a device which has been
	unplugged from the system.  i.e. hot-unplug-support.
   -    "mdadm /dev/mdX --re-add missing" will look for any device
        that looks like it should be a member of /dev/mdX but isn't
	and will automatically --re-add it
   -    Now compile with -Wextra to get extra warnings.
   -    Lots of minor bug fixes, documentation improvements, etcc

This release is believed to be stable and you should feel free to
upgrade to 3.1.3

It is expected that the next release will be 3.2 with a number of new
features.  3.1.4 will only happen if important bugs show up before 3.2
is stable.
