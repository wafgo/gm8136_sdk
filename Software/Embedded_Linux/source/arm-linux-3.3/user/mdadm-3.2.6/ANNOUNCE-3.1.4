Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 3.1.4 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux

I am pleased to announce the availability of
   mdadm version 3.1.4

It is available at the usual places:
   countrycode=xx.
   http://www.${countrycode}kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/
and via git at
   git://neil.brown.name/mdadm
   http://neil.brown.name/git?p=mdadm

This is a bugfix/stability release over 3.1.3.
3.1.3 had a couple of embarrasing regressions and a couple of other
issues surfaces which had easy fixes so I decided to make a 3.1.4
release after all.

Two fixes related to configs that aren't using udev:
   - Don't remove md devices which 'standard' names on --stop
   - Allow dev_open to work on read-only /dev
And fixed regressions:
   - Allow --incremental to add spares to an array
   - Accept --no-degraded as a deprecated option rather than
            throwing an error
   - Return correct success status when --incrmental assembling 
     a container which does not yet have enough devices.
   - Don't link mdadm with pthreads, only mdmon needs it.
   - Fix compiler warning due to bad use of snprintf
   - Fix spare migration

This release is believed to be stable and you should feel free to
upgrade to 3.1.4

It is expected that the next release will be 3.2 with a number of new
features.
