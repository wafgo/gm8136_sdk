Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 3.1.5 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux

I am pleased to announce the availability of
   mdadm version 3.1.5

It is available at the usual places:
   countrycode=xx.
   http://www.${countrycode}kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/
and via git at
   git://neil.brown.name/mdadm
   http://neil.brown.name/git?p=mdadm

This is a bugfix/stability release over 3.1.4.  It contains all the
important bugfixes found while working on 3.2 and 3.2.1.  It will be
the last 3.1.x release - 3.2.1 is expected to be released in a few days.

Changes include:
  - Fixes for v1.x metadata on big-endian machines.
  - man page improvements
  - Improve '--detail --export' when run on partitions of an md array.
  - Fix regression with removing 'failed' or 'detached' devices.
  - Fixes for "--assemble --force" in various unusual cases.
  - Allow '-Y' to mean --export.  This was documented but not implemented.
  - Various fixed for handling 'ddf' metadata.  This is now more reliable
    but could benefit from more interoperability testing.
  - Correctly list subarrays of a container in "--detail" output.
  - Improve checks on whether the requested number of devices is supported
    by the metadata - both for --create and --grow.
  - Don't remove partitions from a device that is being included in an
    array until we are fully committed to including it.
  - Allow "--assemble --update=no-bitmap" so an array with a corrupt
    bitmap can still be assembled.
  - Don't allow --add to succeed if it looks like a "--re-add" is probably
    wanted, but cannot succeed.  This avoids inadvertently turning
    devices into spares when an array is failed.

This release is believed to be stable and you should feel free to
upgrade to 3.1.5
