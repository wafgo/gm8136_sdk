Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 3.2.2 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux

I am pleased to announce the availability of
   mdadm version 3.2.2

It is available at the usual places:
   countrycode=xx.
   http://www.${countrycode}kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/
and via git at
   git://neil.brown.name/mdadm
   http://neil.brown.name/git/mdadm

This release is largely a stablising release for the 3.2 series.
Many of the changes just fix bugs introduces in 3.2 or 3.2.1.

There are some new features.  They are:
  - reshaping IMSM (Intel metadata) arrays is no longer 'experimental',
    it should work properly and be largely compatible with IMSM drivers in
    other platforms.
  - --assume-clean can be used with --grow --size to avoid resyncing the
    new part of the array.  This is only support with very new kernels.
  - RAID0 arrays can have chunksize which is not a power of 2.  This has been
    supported in the kernel for a while but is only now supprted by
    mdadm.

  - A new tool 'raid6check' is available which can check a RAID6 array,
    or part of it, and report which device is most inconsistent with the
    others if any stripe is inconsistent.   This is still under development
    and does not have a man page yet.  If anyone tries it out and has any
    questions or experience to report, they would be most welcome on
    linux-raid@vger.kernel.org.

Future releases in the 3.2 series will only be made if bugfixes are needed.
The next release to add features is expected to be 3.3.
