Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 3.2.3 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux

I am pleased to announce the availability of
   mdadm version 3.2.3

It is available at the usual places:
   countrycode=xx.
   http://www.${countrycode}kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/
and via git at
   git://neil.brown.name/mdadm
   http://neil.brown.name/git/mdadm

This release is largely a bugfix release for the 3.2 series with many
minor fixes with little or no impact.

The largest single area of change is support for reshape of Intel
IMSM arrays (OnLine Capacity Explansion and Level Migtration).
Among other fixes, this now has a better chance of surviving if a
device fails during reshape.

Upgrading is recommended - particularly if you use mdadm for IMSM
arrays - but not essential.
