Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 3.2.5 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux

I am somewhat disappointed to have to announce the availability of
   mdadm version 3.2.5

It is available at the usual places, now including github:
   countrycode=xx.
   http://www.${countrycode}kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/
and via git at
   git://github.com/neilbrown/mdadm
   git://neil.brown.name/mdadm
   http://neil.brown.name/git/mdadm

This release primarily fixes a serious regression in 3.2.4.
This regression does *not* cause any risk to data.  It simply
means that adding a device with "--add" would sometime fail
when it should not.

The fix also includes a couple of minor fixes such as making
the "--layout=preserve" option to "--grow" work again.

A reminder that the default location for runtime files is now
"/run/mdadm".  If you compile this for a distro that does not
have "/run", you will need to compile with an alternate setting for
MAP_DIR. e.g.
   make MAP_DIR=/var/run/mdadm
or
   make MAP_DIR=/dev/.mdadm
