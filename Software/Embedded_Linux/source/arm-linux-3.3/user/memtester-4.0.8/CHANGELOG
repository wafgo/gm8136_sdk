Version 4.0.8
21 November 2007

  -add a startup check for amount of memory being greater than the possible
  address space; prevents user confusion on 32-bit systems that use addressing
  tricks to have >4GB total system memory.  Thanks: Michael Kelly.
  -documentation updates

Version 4.0.7
13 May 2007

  -fix a bug in the align-to-page logic which may have prevented memtester
  from mlock()ing the memory it was trying to test on some systems.
  Thanks: Baif Chen.

Version 4.0.6
15 November 2006

  -test algorithm improvement: the walking 0 bits test was only walking 
  the 0 bit in one direction, instead of walking it up and back down 
  the line the way it was intended to.  Thanks: Tim Rule.
  -formatting cleanups.
  
Version 4.0.5
10 March 2005

  -change to the method of allocating and locking memory; if we get EPERM
  when trying to mlock(), reset the amount of memory desired to the original
  amount and try again without mlock().  The reason for this is that on many
  systems, mlock() won't return EPERM until after having returned ENOMEM for
  a larger amount.  The new behaviour allows processes without mlock privileges
  to still test the fully-specified amount or as much memory as can be 
  allocated.  Thanks for the suggestion and testing to Dan Bradley.

Version 4.0.4
26 August 2004

  -make memtester's exit code meaningful.  See the manpage for its meaning.
  Thanks to Wurzel Parsons-Keir, who sent a patch for the code, so I only had
  to document it.

Version 4.0.3
10 August 2004

  -small changes to enable building with dietlibc and a few other environments
  that don't even attempt to provide the various Posix definitions.
  -cosmetic fixes to output.
  -restore the reduce-and-retry loop of memory locking from version 2.

Version 4.0.2
9 August 2004

  -add manpage

Version 4.0.1
8 August 2004

  -fix cosmetic bugs in output

Version 4.0.0
7 August 2004

  -rewrite to clean up the code (previously an ugly hack), for 64-bit
  cleanliness
  -change build system to build on (hopefully) any platform.  Previous
  versions required hackery on some systems.

Version 3 not publicly released.
