 * of zigzag order.
 *
 * When reading corrupted data, the Huffman decoders could attempt
 * to reference an entry beyond the end of this array (if the decoded
 * zero run length reaches past the end of the block).  To prevent
 * wild stores without adding an inner-loop test, we put some extra
 * "63"s after the real entries.  This will cause the extra coefficient
 * to be stored in location 63 of the block, not somewhere random.
 * The worst case would be a run-length of 15, which means we need 16
 * fake entries.
